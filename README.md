# Hands on Nest Js application development

After React, it's time to get our hands durty with Next Js technology.

## Topics

- Routing/Navigation
- Client and Server Component
- Directives
- Fetch data
- Caching with fetch
- Styling with daisyui
- Get parameters (path variable, search params)
- Layout
- Loading
- Errors
- Page Not found

## Key files you must know

- `page.tsx` reacts as index for each route
- `layout.tsx` for laying out each page can be seen as template
- `loading.tsx` layout loading animation when pages load
- `not-found.tsx` for 404 response on not found pages
- `error.tsx` for any error occuring at the module/path level
- `global-error.tsx` for any error occuring at the application level

## Directives

Directives should be used at the top of the file (line nÂ°1)

- `'use client'` for any page which require user/client action.

## Paths

- `[itemId]` for path `/items/1` for instance - can be nested like `[itemId]/folder/[folderId]` for `items/1/folder/1` for instance.
- `[[slug]]` for path like `/products/category/type?style=styleParam`, in this case you can catch `params` and `searchParams` fron the path.

## Technologies

- React 18
- Next JS 14
- Typescript
- Tailwind CSS
- CSS
- DaisyUI
- Fast sort

## Tips/Caution

When you want to get a parameter on path like '/user/[userID]/' make sure to use "params" like this.

```ts
interface Props {
  params: { paramName: number | string };
}
```

But when you want to get a search parameter like '/user?id=[idParam]/' make sure to use "searchParams" like this instead.

```ts
interface Props {
  searchParams: { paramName: number | string };
}
```
